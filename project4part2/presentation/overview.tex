\frametitle{Implementation Overview}

%We are using \code{C++} with \code{GMP} and so on.
\begine{itemize}
  \item Our project consists of \code{C, C++}, files as well as a \code{Makefile}
  \item As previous presented, it also includes several libraries to help with cryptosystem functionality,
        the main one being the GMP library
  \item The C and C++ files are compiled using \code{make}, which recompiles only code which has been modified,
        as well as linking libraries to the project (such as GMP)
\end{itemize}
