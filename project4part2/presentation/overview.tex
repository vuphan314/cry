% We are using \code{C++} with \code{GMP} and so on.

\begin{itemize}
\item Our project consists of \code{C/C++} files as well
  as a \code{makefile}.
\item As previously mentioned, we use several functions
  included in the C++ standard library, as well as the GMP
  library.
\item The \code{C/C++} files are compiled using
  \code{make}, which only recompiles code which has been
  modified, as well as linking libraries to the project
  (such as GMP).
\end{itemize}
