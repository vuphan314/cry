\begin{itemize}
\item The goal of our project is to develop a framework for
  cryptographers to test their \cs s in a
  secure environment.
\item Users will be able to implement their
  \cs{} in \cry. As the \cs{} is tested, cry will
  output a report that will outline certain details.
  These details will include: estimated time required to
  encrypt, decrypt, as well as the estimated time required
  to crack the cipher using cryptanalysis or brute-force.
\item The report will give details on various aspects of the
  tested system. These details will include time (or
  estimated time) required to encrypt, decrypt, and
  cryptanalyze.
\end{itemize}
