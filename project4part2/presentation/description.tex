\begin{itemize}
\item The goal of our project is to develop a framework for
  cryptographers to test their \cs s.
\item Users will be able to implement their
  \cs{} in \cry. As the \cs{} is tested, cry will
  output a report that will outline certain details.
\item These details include: estimated time required to
  encrypt, decrypt, and crack the cipher using
  cryptanalysis.
\end{itemize}
