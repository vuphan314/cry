\begin{itemize}
\item \cry{} users are \eu s and \cg s.
\item For \eu s, we implemented the \rsa{} \cs.
\item For \cg s, we will implement the \dummy{} \cs:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \dummy{} will serve as a simplistic example
    on how to create a new \cs{} using our \cry{} \cf.
  \item \dummy{} is for demonstration purposes only,
    so \dummy{} needs not be secure.
  \item We will try to make \dummy{} an asymmetric \cs{}
    (like \rsa) instead of a symmetric \cs{} (like \aes).
  \end{itemize}
