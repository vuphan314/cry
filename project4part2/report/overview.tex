\section{Implementation Overview}

% Daniel, please write this.

% We are using \code{C++} with \code{GMP} and so on.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item Our application is written in \code{C++}. There were
  several reasons for this. First, it had all the
  functionality we needed to keep the system in one
  language, without incorporating separate functionalities
  in separate languages. Also, for functions involving large
  numbers, we needed a library that would allow us to not
  only represent large numbers, but also perform the needed
  arithmetic on them. GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) library
  was what we chose for this task. It allows for extremely
  large numbers to be represented, having its only bound
  essentially be the computer's memory.
\item Included in our code is also a \code{makefile}.
  Using the simple \code{make} command, the compiler looks
  for a \code{makefile}, and runs through the recipes,
  compiling only the files that have been changed and need
  to be recompiled. The user can write \code{makefile} to
  specify the dependencies among source files.
\end{itemize}
