\section{Implementation Overview}

Daniel, please write this.

%We are using \code{C++} with \code{GMP} and so on.

Our application is written in \code{C++}. There were several reasons for this.
First, it had all the functionality we needed to keep the system in one language,
 without incorporating separate functionalities in separate languages. Also, for
 functions involving large numbers, we needed a library that would allow us to not
 only represent large numbers, but also perform the needed arithmetic on them.
 GMP (Gnu Multiple Precision) library was what we chose for this task. It allows
 for extremely large numbers to be represented, having its only bound essentially
 be the computer's memory.

Included in our code is also a Makefile. Using the simple \code{make} command,
the compiler looks for a Makefile, and runs through the recipes, compiling only
the files that have been changed and need to be recompiled. The user can write
\code{Makefile} to specify the dependencies among source files.
