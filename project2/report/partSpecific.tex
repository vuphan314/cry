\subsection{External interface requirements}

\subsubsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \eu s are \alice, \bob, and \eve.
\item \alice{} wants to send a confidential message to \bob.
\item \eve{} wants to eavesdrop that message.
\item These \eu s invoke their downloaded \cry{} binaries
  using \cl{} shells.
\item Note: the \cl{} arguments below will be explained later.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Key Generation}
(by \bob, the receiver) \\ \medskip
Input: \generatekeysin
Output: \generatekeysout

\subsubsection{Encryption}
(by \alice, the sender)  \\ \medskip
Input: \encryptin
Output: \encryptout

\subsubsection{Decryption}
(by \bob, the receiver) \\ \medskip
Input: \decryptin
Output: \decryptout

\subsubsection{Cryptanalysis}
(by \eve, the eavesdropper) \\ \medskip
Input: \cryptanalyzein
Output: \cryptanalyzeout
