(by \vp)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Interface}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \eu s are \alice, \bob, and \eve.
\item \alice{} wants to send a confidential message to \bob.
\item \eve{} wants to eavesdrop that message.
\item These \eu s invoke their downloaded \cry{} binaries
  using \cl{} shells.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}

Minimum hardware: \\ \medskip
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
RAM & 4 GB \\ \hline
CPU & 1.5 GHz
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Key Generation}
(by \bob, the receiver) \\ \medskip
Input: \generatekeysin
Output: \generatekeysout
Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \csarg{} is the name of an available \cs, such as \code{rsa}
\item \publickeyarg{} and \privatekeyarg{} are integers
\item \generatekeystime{} (how long the command takes)
  shall be less than 1 minute
  (with the aforementioned minimum hardware)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Encryption}
(by \alice, the sender)  \\ \medskip
Input: \encryptin
Output: \encryptout
Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \plaintextarg{} is an obviously meaningful string,
  such as \plaintextex
\item \ciphertextarg{} is an apparently meaningless string,
  such as \ciphertextex

Input: \cryptanalyzein
Output: \cryptanalyzeout
Requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cryptanalyzetime{} shall be more than 1 day
\end{itemize}
