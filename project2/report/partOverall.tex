\subsection{Product Perspective}

\cry{} will be implemented as a \cf{} with built-in \cs s
updated as needed. No other frameworks are needed to run
\cry; it is standalone. It will be used as a
tool for cryptographers and developers alike, and all \cs s
will be self-contained in \cry.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
\cry{} will be used as a command line application, being
accessed with the command \code{cry}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Product Functions}

The essential functions of \cry{} can be broken into two
separate parts: testing and reporting.

\subsubsection{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Users shall be able to develop new \cs s{}
  by defining key-generation, encryption, decryption,
  and cryptanalysis algorithms.
\item Users shall be able to test their \cs s' security.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Upon performing a test, a user will receive a report on
  the \cs.
\item The report will indicate the security level of the \cs.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{User Characteristics}

Users of \cry{} will most likely have at least a medium
level of experience with cryptography. To use advanced
features of \cry, users will need a high level of \cryptos{}
experience.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Constraints}

\cry{} will need certain base requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item basic memory and CPU availability
  \item command line permissions
\end{itemize}

In addition to baseline requirements, parallel operation and
interfacing with other applications may become necessary if
future library additions dictate such.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

Few assumptions are needed as \cry{} will run on all
operating systems and is a standalone framework. The single
assumption to be made, as mentioned in constraints, is that
certain permissions may be needed from the command line.
These are assumed to be available for all users.
