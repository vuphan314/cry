\subsection{Product perspective}

\cry{} will be implemented as a \cf{} with built-in \cs s
updated as needed. No other frameworks are needed to run
\cry; it is standalone. It will be used as a
tool for cryptographers and developers alike, and all \cs s
will be self-contained in \cry.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
\cry{} will be used as a command line application, being
accessed with the command \code{cry}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Product functions}

The essential functions of \cry{} can be broken into two
separate parts: testing and reporting.

\subsubsection{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Users shall be able to develop new \cs s{}
  by defining key-generation, encryption, decryption,
  and cryptanalysis algorithms.
\item Users shall be able to test their \cs s' security.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Upon performing a test, users will receive feedback on their methods.
  \item Reports will be shown to suggest the security of the \cs and to give helpful feedback
  in the area of weaknesses in the \cs.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{User characteristics}

User of \cry{} will most likely have a medium to high level of experience with \cs s. This is not a requirement,
it is an open application. However, \cry{} aims to aid the developing \cs s, and this is implies a high level of experience.
If more complicated libraries are implemented, users will need a high level of experience to uderstand these methods and therefore apply
them.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Constraints}

\cry{} will need certain base requirements
\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic memory and CPU availability
  \item Command line permissions
\end{itemize}

In addition to baseline requirements, parallel operation and interfacing with other applications may become necessary if
future library additions dictate such.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}

Few assumptions are needed as \cry{} will run on all operating systems and is a standalone framework. The single assumption to be
made, as mentioned in constraints, is that certain permissions may be needed from the command line. These are assumed to be available for all users.
