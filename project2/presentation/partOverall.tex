\section{Overall description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Product perspective}

\begin{frame} % begin/end a frame aka slide
\frametitle{Product Perspective}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cry{} will be implemented as a stand-alone framework, with built in libraries updated as needed. 
  \item User interface will start as command line-based, possibility of implementing with GUI
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Product functions}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Product Functions}
Testing
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develope new cryptosystems
  \item Test cryptosystems against cracking techniques and generate helpful output
\end{itemize}
Reporting
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users will receive feedback from output of their test
  \item Reports will be shown to suggest the security of the cryptosystem and to give helpful feedback
    in the area of weaknesses in the cryptosystem.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% Add frames if needed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{User characteristics}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{User Characteristics}
Users will most likely have a medium  to high level of experience cryptosystems.
\end{frame}
% Add frames if needed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Constraints}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic memory and CPU availability
  \item Further library implementations or updates may require parallel operation or interfacing with other applications
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
% Add frames if needed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Assumptions and dependencies}
Only assumption of the system (\cry{}) is that it has applicable adminstrative permissions at the command line
\end{frame}
% Add frames if needed.
