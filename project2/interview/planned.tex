\begin{question}
Currently, the app will briefly describe whether your created
algorithm is breakable within a given time frame. Would it be
helpful to have a more detailed report, and, if so, what other
info would be helpful to see on that report?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
The current app will have built in cryptographic functions to use and 
compare with your own (including RSA and Diffie-Helman). What others
would you like to see included (such as hashing algorithms, network stream siphers, etc.),
and why?
\end{question}
