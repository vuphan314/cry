\section{Expectation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Usability:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For \eu s: \cry{} enables \eu s to establish
    secure communication via simple \cl{} options.
  \item For \cg s:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Being a modular object-oriented framework,
      \cry{} lets \cg s easily define new \cs s.
    \item \cry{} also reports the security measures
      of these \cs s.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Limitation of \cry{} compared to
  the existing \charm{} \cf:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \charm{} is used for anaylizing \cs s
    implemented in Python and C.
  \item \charm{} has advanced functionalities
    that we will be unable to provide in \cry{}
    due to time constraints.
  \item \cry{} will have a similar base for sandboxing
    and prototyping \cs s.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
