\begin{itemize}
\item Usability:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \cry{} enables \eu s to establish
    secure communication via simple \cl{} options.
  \item Being a modular object-oriented framework,
    \cry{} lets \cg s easily define and benchmark new \cs s.
  \end{itemize}
  new systems show analysis on their current security standing, letting the developer know if additional security is needed
  
  cryptosystems will be continually built in and checked with cry (similar to the RSA example) and can be used to verify the security of
  a new user/developer's system
\end{itemize}
(new item) Related applications
  Charm framework - used for testing cryptographic systems implemented in python 
  
  Has extended functionalities that we won't be able to provide due to time constraints
  
  Our application will have a similar base for sandboxing and prototyping possible systems
