\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item For \eu s:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Problem: An \eu{} wants to send and receive
    secure messages with other \eu s.
  \item Solution: \cry{} lets \eu s establish
    secure communication via built-in \cs s.
  \end{itemize}
\item For \cg s:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Problem: New \cs s need to be developed.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Reason: Most existing \cs s are secure
      only if their assumptions are true.
    \item Example: The RSA \cs's security relies on
      the assumption that integer factorization is hard.
      It is currenly unknown whether
      a polynomial-time factorizing algorithm exists.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Solution: \cry{} let \cg s easily prototype
    and test their new \cs s.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
