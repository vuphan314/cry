\subsection{Incomplete Functionality}

Based on our project plan from the last iteration, we have completed what we
expected to complete. However,there are functionalities that we originally set
out to include that were not able to make it.The first of these functionalities
was the ability for the Cry system to suggest improvements to a user-implemented
cryptosystem. It would have been a good feature to have a general set of guidelines
that the user's system could be evaluated on, and, if it did not meet some
criteria, to suggest an improvement. This would have been a valuable tool, but
ultimately we did not have time to include this. Another feature that would have
been useful to implement for the system is an automatic git add/commit/push/pull
etc. feature. As is, when a user selects an action to perform they can do a command
for that action and a file will be generated for us to read the contents of (for
key generation, encryption, decryption, cryptanalysis). However, once the file is
created it must be pushed to the git repository by the user. This is not difficult
for them, but it would be an added convenience if this was done automatically.
