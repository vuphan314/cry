parties:
\begin{itemize}
\item sender
\item receiver
\item eavesdropper
\end{itemize}

terminology:
\begin{itemize}
\item each \textdef{key-element} is a big positive integer:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $n$: modulus (known to: all parties)
  \item $e$: public-exponent (known to: all parties)
  \item $E$: public-factor (known to: all parties)
  \item $d$: private-exponent (known to: only receiver)
  \item $D$: secret-factor
    (known to: only sender \& receiver)
  \end{itemize}
\item each \textdef{key} is a triple of key-elements:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $(n, e, E)$: public-key
  \item $(n, d, D)$: private-key
  \end{itemize}
\item each \textdef{padded-text} is a string:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $c$: padded-ciphertext (known to: all parties)
  \item $m$: padded-plaintext
    (known to: only sender \& receiver)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item key-generation:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the receiver generates $\set{n, e, d}$,
    using \rsa-key-generation \\
    (the \rsa-\cs{} is embedded in the \dummy-\cs)
  \item the sender randomly generates $D$
  \item the sender encrypts $D$ into $E$,
    using \rsa-encryption with \rsa-public-key $(n, e)$
  \item the receiver decrypts $E$ into $D$,
    using \rsa-decryption with \rsa-private-key $(n, d)$
  \item now both the sender and receiver know $D$
  \end{enumerate}
\item encryption:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the sender pads the plaintext into $m$
  \item the sender encrypts $m$ into $c = m * D$
  \end{enumerate}
\item decryption:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the receiver decrypts $c$ into $m = c / D$
  \item the receiver unpads $m$ into the plaintext
  \end{enumerate}
\item cryptanalysis:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the eavesdropper cryptanalyzes $\set{n, e}$
    into $d$, using \rsa-cryptanalyis
  \item the eavesdropper decrypts $E$ into $D$,
    using \rsa-decryption with \rsa-private-key $(n, d)$
  \item the eavesdropper decrypts $c$ into $m = c / D$
  \item the eavesdropper unpads $m$ into the plaintext
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
