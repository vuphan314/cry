parties:
\begin{itemize}
\item sender
\item receiver
\item eavesdropper
\end{itemize}

terminology:
\begin{itemize}
\item each \textdef{key-element} is a big positive integer:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $n$: modulus (known to: all parties)
  \item $e$: public-exponent (known to: all parties)
  \item $E$: public-factor (known to: all parties)
  \item $d$: private-exponent (known to: only receiver)
  \item $D$: secret-factor
    (known to: only sender \& receiver)
  \end{itemize}
\item each \textdef{key} is a triple of key-elements:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $(n, e, E)$: public-key
  \item $(n, d, D)$: private-key
  \end{itemize}
\item each \textdef{padded-text} is a string:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $m$: padded-plaintext
  \item $c$: padded-ciphertext
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
\item key-generation:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the receiver uses the \rsa{} \cs{}
    (embeded in the \dummy{} \cs) to generate $n, e, d$
  \item the sender randomly generates $D$
  \item the sender encrypts $D$ into $E$
    using \rsa-encryption with \rsa-public-key $(n, e)$
  \item the receiver decrypts $E$ into $D$
    using \rsa-decryption with \rsa-private-key $(n, d)$
  \item now both the sender and receiver know $D$
  \end{enumerate}
\item encryption:
\end{itemize}
