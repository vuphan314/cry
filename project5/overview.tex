\section{Project overview}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Project Definition}
\cry{} is a framework developed primarily to allow
\cg{}s to prototype and test new cryptosystems. \cry{} will
also allow non-\cg{}s to send and receive messages
securely, using GitHub as the exhange medium.

\subsection{Project Motivation}
Our motive in devloping \cry{} was because we are interested
in \cgy{}, and we wanted to familiarize ourselves with
some of the tools that \cg{}s might use.
