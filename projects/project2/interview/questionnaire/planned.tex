\subsection{Planned Functionality}

\begin{question}
The \cry{} \cf{} will briefly describe whether your created
\ca{} is breakable within a given time frame.
Would it be helpful to have a more detailed report?
If so, what other infomation should be on that report?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
\cry{} will have some built-in \ca s,
including \rsa{} and \eg.
What other \ca s
(such as hashing algorithms and network stream ciphers)
should be included and why?
\end{question}
