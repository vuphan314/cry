\section{Prototype}

\begin{itemize}
\item \bob{} (receiver)
  creates a public \github{} repository and
  adds \alice{} (sender) \& \eve{} (eavesdropper)
  as collaborators
\item \bob{} adds the binary file \cryout{}
  to the repository
\item \bob{} inserts the line \code{*.pr}
  into the file \code{.gitignore}
\item \bob{} commits and pushes the changes
\item everyone pulls from \github{}
  before doing the following actions
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Key Generation}
by \bob \bigskip

Shell input: \generatekeysindemo
Shell output: \generatekeysoutdemo

File \public{\bobdemo}:
\codestt{\lstinputlisting{../../project5/demo/bob.public}}

File \private{\bobdemo}:
\codestt{\lstinputlisting{../../project5/demo/bob.private}}

\bob{} adds, commits, and pushes
the file \public{\bobdemo} to \github.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Encryption}
by \alice \bigskip

\alice{} creates the file \private{\alicedemo} (plaintext):
\codestt{\lstinputlisting{../../project5/demo/alice.private}}

Shell input: \encryptindemo
Shell output: \encryptoutdemo

File \public{\alicedemo} (padded ciphertext):
\codestt{\lstinputlisting{../../project5/demo/alice.public}}

\alice{} adds, commits, and pushes
the file \public{\alicedemo} to \github.

\subsection{Decryption}
by \bob \bigskip

Shell input: \decryptindemo
Shell output: \decryptoutdemo

\subsection{Cryptanalysis}
by \eve \bigskip

Shell input: \cryptanalyzeindemo
Shell output: \cryptanalyzeoutdemo
