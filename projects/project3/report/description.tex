\section{Project Description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The goal of our project is to develop a framework for
cryptographers to easily test their \cs s in a
secure environment. Users will be able to implement their
\cs{} securely in Cry, and upon testing it, they will
receive a report that will explain results of a particular
test as well as ways to improve the system.

\medskip

This report will be a useful tool for cryptographers. It
will give details on various aspects of the tested system.
These details will include time (or estimated time) required
to encrypt, decrypt, and cryptanalyze. When analyzing a
cryptanalysis method, Cry will hope to give some useful
suggestions as to why the system was broken in the given
time, and what could be used to improve it in further
iterations.
