\frametitle{Project Description}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The goal of our project is to develop a framework for
    cryptographers to easily test their \cs s in a
    secure environment.
  \item Users will be able to implement their
    \cs{} securely in Cry, and upon testing it, they will
    receive a report that will explain results of a particular
    test as well as ways to improve the system.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Description cont.}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The will give details on various aspects of the tested system.
    These details will include time (or estimated time) required
    to encrypt, decrypt, and cryptanalyze.
  \item When analyzing a
    cryptanalysis method, Cry will hope to give some useful
    suggestions as to why the system was broken in the given
    time, and what could be used to improve it in further
    iterations.
  \end{itemize}
