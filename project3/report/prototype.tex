\section{Prototype}

\begin{itemize}
\item \bob{} (receiver)
  creates a public \github{} repository and
  adds \alice{} (sender) \& \eve{} (eavesdropper)
  as collaborators
\item \bob{} adds the binary file \cryout{}
  to the repository
\item \bob{} inserts the line \code{*.private}
  into the file \code{.gitignore}
\item \bob{} commits and pushes the changes
\item everyone pulls from \github{}
  before doing the following actions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Generation}
by \bob \bigskip

Shell input: \generatekeysindemo
Shell output: \generatekeysoutdemo

File \private{\bobdemo}:
