\section{Project Description}

The goal of our project is to develope a framework for cryptographers to easily test their
cryptosystems in a secure environment. Users will be able to implement their cryptosystem securely
in Cry, and upon testing it, they will receive a report that will explain results of a particular
test as well as ways to improve the system.

This report will be a useful tool for cryptographers. It will give details on various aspects of the
tested system. These details will include time (or estimated time) required to encrypt, decrypt, and break.
When analysing a breaking method, Cry will hope to give some useful suggestions as to why the system was
broken in the given time, and what could be used to improve it in further iterations.
